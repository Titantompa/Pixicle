<p>Pixicle is a concept based on the WiFi enabled devices of <a href="http://www.particle.io">Particle Industries</a> in combination with a strip of programmable LEDs (e g WS2811 and derivatives), commonly referred to as NeoPixels (a brand used by <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/">Adafruit</a> for their programmable LED strips).</p>

<p>A Pixicle is in essence a cloud-connected microcontroller driving a strip of LEDs. The firmware is an extendable framework addressable through a generic and cloud-based interface. The applications range from simple ambient mood lightning (controller by the accompanying Android application) to more elaborate IoT-configurations where the lights could be used to indicate events, progress or various metrics.</p>

<a id="what-do-you-need" class="anchor" href="#what-do-you-need" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What do you need</h3>

<p>In order to build a Pixicle you need five major components:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>A Particle device</strong> (Core or Photon).<br>
  Available from multiple sources, world-wide. For prototyping purposes a Photon kit (with breadboard) is recommended.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A LED Strip</strong> (e g WS2812B et al).<br>
  Also available in vast variations from more or less reputable world-wide distributors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A logic level converter</strong><br>
  The microcontroller uses 3.3V logic while the LEDs use 5V. This could be a custom converter (built on a fast 74125 logic chip or an optocoupler if isolation is needed) or a product such as <a href="Sparkfun's">http://www.sparkfun.com</a>'s <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12009">Logic Level Converter</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A Power Supply</strong><br>
   While the microcontroller doesn't require much, each of the LEDs could peak at 0.3W. This quickly sums up to boggling levels of current.<br>
   The Particle devices feature an on-board regulator which makes it possible to drive both the microcontroller and LED-strip from the same 5 Volt power supply. Note that the LED-strips themselves are measly conductors and that you'd probably want to connect the power supply at more than one place if the strip exceeds about five metres.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Apart from these requisites you would also need some form of fixture to mount the components to, obviously.</p>

<a id="required-skills" class="anchor" href="#required-skills" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Required skills</h3>

<p>Even though you'd get very far with a breadboard you will most likely need a soldering iron and some rudimentary skills to get all the connectors and wires to hook up properly.</p>

<p>If you want to add modes and functionality to either the microcontroller or the Android application you need programming skills. The microntroller is programmed using C++ while the Android application is Java.</p>

<p>To produce something beyond a prototype (even if it is just a one-off device) you will also need some mechanical and general fiddling skills (along with appropriate tools).</p>

<h3>
<a id="required-software-tools" class="anchor" href="#required-software-tools" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Required Software Tools</h3>

<p>The Android app is build using the <a href="https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html">Android Studio</a> while the firmware for the Particle devices is built using <a href="https://www.particle.io/dev">Particle Dev</a>.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>The Android app and Particle firmware was originally written by Tomas HÃ¼bner (<a href="https://github.com/titantompa" class="user-mention">@titantompa</a>). The work started during the Christmas holidays 2014 and was completed during the same holidays a year later (2015).
The Android app uses a color picker written by <a href="https://github.com/LarsWerkman" class="user-mention">@LarsWerkman</a> and the firmware uses a library to communicate with the NeoPixels adapted to the Particle devices by <a href="https://github.com/technobly" class="user-mention">@technobly</a>.</p>
